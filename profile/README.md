# About us

The Centre for Homelessness Impact exists to improve the lives of people experiencing homelessness through better use of data and evidence.

We exist to see an end to homelessness for good. 

Our mission is to act as a catalyst for evidence-led change to enable people working in and around homelessness to achieve breakthrough results.
